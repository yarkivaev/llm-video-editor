Create a heartwarming family vacation video that tells the story of our beach day. 

Start with a title card saying "Our Perfect Beach Day" and then show the best moments from our beach footage. Include the beautiful sunset photo as a closing shot to end on a peaceful note.

Make it feel cinematic and emotional - this is a memory we want to treasure forever. The video should flow naturally from setup, to fun activities, to a beautiful ending.

Keep it under 60 seconds but make every moment count!
